Your Goal: Find the Longer Half

Let's find the longer half of the string before and after the x!

1- First, you'll need to find the lower-case x.
2- Once you've found the x, split the string in half. The first half will be the string before the x, the second half will be the string after the x.
3- Take the longer string and return it!

function splitAtX(string) {
    const xPos = string.indexOf('x');
    const firstHalf = string.slice(0,xPos);
    const lastHalf = string.slice(xPos+1);
    if(firstHalf.length > lastHalf.length) {
        return firstHalf;
    }
    return lastHalf;
   
}

module.exports = splitAtX;
