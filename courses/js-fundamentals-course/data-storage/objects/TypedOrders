 Your Goal: Create an Enumeration
Let's create an enumeration like CARD_SUITS above. Our enumeration will be named ORDER_TYPES and describe the different types of orders that are possible in our system.

The first type should be PIZZA, with a value of 0.

After that, create at least 2 more options of your choice!

const ORDER_TYPES = {
    PIZZA: 0,
    SALAD: 1,
    BURGER: 2,
    FRIES: 3
    
}

module.exports = ORDER_TYPES;
