Your Goal: Complete the Summation

1- We want to write a function summation that will find the sum of all the values from 1 to (and including) n. The value n is passed into our function.
2- Similar to the for loop above, you can initialize some value i to start at 1. The value should reach n but never exceed it.

answer


function summation(n) {
    let sum = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i <=n; i++) {
        sum = sum + i;
        
    }

    return sum;
}

module.exports = summation;
